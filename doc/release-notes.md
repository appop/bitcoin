Compatibility
==============

nealcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support).
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

nealcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
